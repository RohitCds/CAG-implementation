Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) with Hugging Face Transformers
This project demonstrates the concept of Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) using Hugging Face's pre-trained language models. The purpose is to improve efficiency by caching previously generated text based on user input. Instead of generating new text every time the same prompt is encountered, the system will fetch the response from the cache, reducing computational resources and time.

Project Overview
What is Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)?
Cache-Augmented Generation is a method used to store previously generated responses from a language model in a cache. When the same prompt is encountered again, the system will check the cache first to avoid regenerating the response. This is especially useful when generating text for repetitive or similar queries, as it saves computational resources and improves response time.

Key Components:
Hugging Face Transformers: The project uses Hugging Face's distilgpt2, a smaller, more efficient version of the GPT-2 language model, for text generation.
Caching: The prompt is hashed to create a unique identifier, and generated responses are cached using a dictionary for efficient retrieval.
